Yin Nan has nothing to do at home all day, waiting for the beauty to make money and come back to raise him. This makes Mei Ai feel very angry. The dual pressures of work and life have made Meiai start to look for excitement in other men. By going to bed with a strange man, Mei love seems to be able to vent a little dissatisfaction with the world. Over time, this has become her habit.  　　Next to Yin Nan’s family, a beautiful woman named Yi Yin (Jin Zhiyuan) was moved.

By chance, Yin Nan and Yi Yin met, and the two lonely hearts quickly approached. Mei Ai found that Yin Nan’s attitude towards himself was a lot colder, and he began to want to study the reasons behind it.",

Hercules was the powerful son of the god king Zeus, for this he received nothing but suffering his entire life. After twelve arduous labors and the loss of his family, this dark, world-weary soul turned his back on the gods finding his only solace in bloody battle. Over the years he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love of fighting and presence of death. These men and woman never question where they go to fight or why or whom, just how much they will be paid. Now the King of Thrace has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time. It is time for this bunch of lost souls to finally have their eyes opened to how far they have fallen when they must train an army to become as ruthless and blood thirsty as their reputation has become.",
